What is IRC?
=============

`Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat>`_ is an application
protocol to do text based communication. It was created in 1988 and still
being used as one of the primary communication medium for many people around
the world, including various Free and Open Source software projects.

We use IRC as our primary communication medium because it works with low bandwidth.
You don't need super fast internet connection to attend the summer training sessions. Also,
later when you will try to contact other communities, you will find most of them
are active on IRC.

What is a channel?
-------------------

Every IRC server has various virtual groups or rooms (think of chat-rooms) where people can
communicate with each other. These are known as channels. The channel names
start with *#* sign. For example, **#dgplug** is the channel name in Freenode
server for our training.

IRC clients
------------

There are various IRC clients, for our sessions you can use:
**hexchat** client on your computer , or
**androIRC** client for your phone  


hexchat
--------

hexchat is a popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client. It has a choice of a tabbed
document interface or tree interface, support for multiple servers and is highly
configurable.

IRC on the Web
---------------

While a client (xchat, hexchat, etc), on any platform, is the best way to
experience IRC on a daily basis, you can in fact use your web browser to
connect to IRC!

While it might not be as comfortable as a native client, irc via a browser is
actually quite full featured.

It depends on you knowing commands though, so `this page on the IRC beginner
website <http://ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html>`_ will come in
real handy.

So let’s start at the very beginning.

Here’s what we’d need for our summer sessions.

1. We need a browser
2. We need an username that stays the same, throughout sessions
3. We need to login to the #dgplug channel on `freenode <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_ with that username

Step 1. The Browser
-------------------

Congratulations!

You’ve already have one and are successfully connected, if you’re reading this
:)

Step 2. A username for IRC.
---------------------------

Let’s mosey over to the `freenode website <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_

|

.. figure:: img/webirc/webirc-1.png

| 

| Login with the username you want, like I’ve done here.
| I’ve chosen ``mariojason`` for a username.
| Ignore the channel and auth options for now.  
| Just clear the I am not a robot test. 

|

And you should enter the world of irc!

There’ll be a lot of stuff that’ll end with a screen like this.

|

|

| You’ll obviously have figured out that the little white box at the bottom is where you type in your messages and commands. 
| You can type ``/quit`` to quit your connection for example.
| Also note the tab that says “status” (not visible in the pic) above at the top of your window. 
| You’ll want to click this tab before typing in sensitive IRC commands (as you will do shortly).
| You’ll see more tabs at the top as you join channels later and you’ll use the tabs to switch between them.

| You in with your username? Good.
| Now let’s register it so that we can always have the same one.
| Type the command ``/msg NickServ REGISTER <password> <email>``, where password will be some complicated password of yours while email is where you put in your email address
| You can see me doing it below

If all works well, Nickserv will reply saying that activation instructions
have been sent to your email id, like so …

|

So hop over and check your mail. This is what you should expect to see.

|

Let’s copy the ``/msg`` line and go back to the irc page and paste it in the
chat bar like so …

|

|

And voila! You should be verified!

|

Now that we’re done registering our nickname, quit the connection by typing in
the ``/quit`` command and let’s move to …

Step 3. Connecting to the DGPLUG channel.
-----------------------------------------

Now we’re back to `where we started <https://webchat.freenode.net>`_.

Only this time, fill in all the details.

1. Put in your nickname
2. Use #dgplug as the channel to connect
3. Enable auth to services
4. The username is the same as the nickname
5. Fill in the complicated password that you had created for your id.

And hit Connect!
